# Divvun Dev Keyboard

This repository exists for the purposes of triggering CI and CD. It is a kbdgen meta-repository, and serves as the basis for the content of the mobile keyboard apps.

If you want your keyboard to be built, update `divvun-dev.kbdgen/targets/android.yaml` or `divvun-dev.kbdgen/targets/ios.yaml`. [This](https://github.com/divvun/divvun-dev-keyboard/commit/c62eeaf12b3619ef7898f958f1371f52eca0ac0c) is the kind of edit you're looking for. 

Edits to the layouts should happen in the keyboard repos in [GiellaLT](https://github.com/giellalt), one repo for each language.
